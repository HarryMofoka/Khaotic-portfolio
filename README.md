## 🌪️ The Concept: "Controlled Disorder"
Khaotic represents a shift away from clinical, grid-locked design towards something more organic, analog, and raw. It celebrates the noise, the grain, and the "mistakes" that make digital work feel human.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Bundler**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animation**: [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) (GreenSock Animation Platform) + [ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/)
- **Smooth Scroll**: [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/)
- **Audio**: Web Audio API (Procedural Ambient Sound)
- **Typography**: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (Inter & Rock Salt)

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. "Enter the Mind" (Hero)
A generative noise field powered by Simplex Noise and HTML5 Canvas. The background reacts to cursor movement, creating a unique texture for every visitor.

### 2. "Projects That Breathe"
Portfolio pieces rendered as film-stills with:
- **Video Previews**: Instant feedback on hover.
- **Micro-Rotations**: Randomized angles for a scattered layout.
- **Parallax Depth**: Floating layers that shift with scroll.

### 3. Sensory Polish
- **Context-Aware Cursor**: A custom cursor system that changes state based on element interaction (Default, View, Lab, Text).
- **Ink Trail**: A canvas-rendered fading trail that follows the mouse.
- **Multi-Mood System**: Cycle between *Default (Dark)*, *Light*, *Midnight (Blue)*, and *Ember (Amber)* themes.
- **Procedural Audio**: An opt-in ambient drone system generated in real-time.

### 4. "The Lab" & "The Creator"
- **The Lab**: A freeform grid showcasing experimental work with status-aware badges.
- **The Creator**: A personalized about section featuring an infinite-scrolling skills marquee and GSAP-revealed portrait.
